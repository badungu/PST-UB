This is my first attempt in modding, maybe it doesn't work, that's why I didn't leave any comment in the forums for now.

PST-UB is a Mod for Planescape Torment, which restores unfinished content.

This is an attempt to update it for the Enhanced Edition.

All credit goes to Qwinn and the other contributors (see original readme inside the Modfolder)

If you're willing to contribute, please contact me and I will add you to the project

Currently nothing is tested ingame (!) only the installation process, if you install this, strange things may happen! ;)

Following components aren't compatible yet:
- Restored Candlestick Quest:
Have to figure out how the colors and color placement are handled inside creature files in PST:EE.
Have to find right animation files for creatures

- Restored Curst Prisoners & Restored Carl Parfidor:
Have to figure out how the Character type is set in PST:EE (Animation.ini->BGEE.lua?)

- Restored Party Comments and Banters & Restored Bestiary Entries:
Both uses exe patches, have to figure out if these can be done in PST:EE without modifying the executable.

Todo in future releases:
- Check components not compatible yet (see above)
- Find someone who has the knowledge of writing patches for the executables
- Check the text (don't know if anything is changed in PST:EE regarding item text conventions)
[I only can do this for german, english is not my native language]
- Add HANDLE_CHARSETS
- Testing testing testing and testing! :D
