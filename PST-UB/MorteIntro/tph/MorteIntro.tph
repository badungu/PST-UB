// ================================== MORTE'S ORIGINAL INTRO ================================
// ========================== ORIGINALLY RESTORED BY RESTORATION PACK =======================
// ======================== COMPLETELY REVAMPED AND WEIDUIZED BY QWINN ======================


// The main Morte dialog file the game ships with (DMORTE.DLG) contains an introductory conversation
// with Morte that is much like all the other conversations in game - you have multiple options in
// what you say, lots of different conversation paths to explore, etc.  Someone must have felt
// that players just starting out wouldn't be familiar with so many dialog options and would
// need their hand held a bit more at the beginning, so they produced DMORTE1.DLG, which has a
// lobotomized, railroaded version with almost no options in your responses.

// This UB component restores Morte's introduction to the originally intended more complex version,
// for those who enjoy multiple dialog options and conversational paths.  You can get quite a lot
// more dialog out of Morte in the original intro if you dig for it.


// I'm doing this totally different from the way Restoration Pack did it.  Here are the differences
// between my version and Restoration Pack's:

// 1) After the original conversation is over, I go back to using DMORTE1.DLG, because the interjections
// around the 1st and 2nd rooms are a bit more fleshed out in the version that shipped.

// 2) I'm -not- completely overwriting DMORTE1.DLG with DMORTE.DLG and changing the triggers.
// DMORTE1.DLG remains untouched.

// 3) If you simply ignore Morte and abort the "original intro", then talk to him again, he'll repeat
// his concern for you (reasonable since you just ignored him) and then you will get the DMORTE1.DLG
// conversation that actually shipped.  So if you install this mod, you -can- still see either
// introductory conversation, you don't have to uninstall to see the way the game shipped.


// Did I make any changes to the "original intro" dialog as it was actually in DMORTE.DLG?  Only
// three:

// 1)  The first line by Morte when you wake up doesn't have the audio file attached.  I make sure
// he keeps his voice.

// 2)  Removed a leftover debug response to that first line that was clearly meant only for testing,
// skips the whole conversation (I use it myself when testing the early game, heh)

// 3)  The "original intro" has the following as what's written on your back (STRREF 1117):

// ===========================================================================================
// ~"Looks like directions..." Morte clears his throat. "Let's see. It starts with..."
//
// NOTE: "I know you feel like you've been drinking a few kegs of Styx wash, but you need to
// center yourself. Among your possessions should be a JOURNAL that'll shed some light on the
// dark of the matter. PHAROD should be able to fill you in on the rest of the chant, if he's
// not in the deadbook already.
//
// "Don't lose this scrap of flesh OR the journal or we'll be up the Styx again, right? And trust
// me, whatever you do, DO NOT tell anyone WHO you are, WHAT happens to you, or WHERE you came
// from or you'll find yourself on a short trip to the crematorium."~
// ===========================================================================================

// This doesn't match the many other STRREF's that quote the scars on your back (like your journal,
// asking Morte later, etc.) and honestly, it's not very good.  You'd expect what you've had carved
// on your back to be a bit more concise and a good bit less conversationally chatty, "right?"
//
// The version of your scars that shipped with the game is much better, and not fixing it would
// make it inconsistent with the rest of the game.  I make sure it all stays consistent. (see below)

// Otherwise, the quite long and involved "original intro" you're getting here is exactly as it was
// written by the Black Isle folks and as it shipped with the game in DMORTE.DLG.  Enjoy!
